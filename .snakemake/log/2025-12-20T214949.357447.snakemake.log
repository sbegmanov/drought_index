MissingOutputException in rule get_all_archive in file "C:\Users\proper\Desktop\drought_index\Snakefile", line 8:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/ghcnd_all.tar.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: ghcnd-inventory.txt, ghcnd-stations.txt, ghcnd_all_files.txt, README.md)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
